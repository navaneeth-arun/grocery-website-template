        <h2>Challenges</h2> <br><br>
        <h3>The Food is Ending</h3> <br>
        <p id="text">There are reports of food shortages in different parts of the world. In some cases, this is due to bad weather conditions that have affected crops. In other cases, it is due to conflict or economic problems. <br>
            In many cases, the shortages are causing people to go hungry. This is especially a problem for children, who are particularly vulnerable to malnutrition. There are also reports of people resorting to desperate measures, such as eating insects, in order to try and stave off hunger. <br>
            The food shortages are having a huge impact on people's lives. In some cases, they are causing people to flee their homes in search of areas where there is more food. This is leading to an increase in refugees and internally displaced people. <br> 
            The food shortages are also likely to have a long-term impact on countries' economies and development. They could lead to inflation and other economic problems, as well as hampering efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.</p> <br> <br>
        <h3>Solution -  Vertical Farming</h3> <br>
        <p id="text">There are a few things that can be done in order to help. One is to support organizations that are working to end food insecurity, such as the World Food Programme. Another is to donate money or time to local food banks or soup kitchens. Finally, spreading awareness about the issue can help encourage others to take action as well.</p>
